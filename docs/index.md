# 1. Overview

Pup is a powerful process manager for Deno, designed to simplify the management of your applications and services. Here are some of the key features:

- **Cross-platform and wide OS compatibility:** Manage processes for various languages and platforms, such as Deno, Node.js, Python, and Ruby on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Process management:** Define, control, and manage your processes with simple commands and configuration options.
- **Multiple start/restart policies:** Set up processes to start automatically, on a schedule (using cron expressions), or when files change.
- **Service management**: Built-in installer for Linux (sysvinit, systemd, upstart), macOS, and Windows services.
- **Clustering and load balancing:** Scale your application seamlessly with built-in clustering and load balancing capabilities.
- **Plugins:** Extend Pup's functionality with custom plugins for additional features and integrations.
- **Process Telemetry and IPC:** Pup can gather telemetry data from Deno client processes, such as memory usage and current working directory, providing deeper insights into managed processes. The
  telemetry feature also enables inter-process communication, allowing connected processes to interact with one another.

> **Note** Programmatic usage, process telemetry, and IPC are currently available only when running Deno client processes.

Pup is centered on a single configuration file, ideally named `pup.json` or `pup.jsonc`, which manages all aspects of the processes to be executed, including their execution methods and logging
handling.
