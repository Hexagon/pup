# Using pup with Docker

---

The example at [/docs/examples/docker](https://github.com/Hexagon/pup/tree/main/docs/examples/docker) runs a Deno script periodically with Pup in the official Deno docker imag.

## Files

- [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Hexagon/pup/tree/main/docs/examples/docker/Dockerfile) - Sets up a container based on `denoland/deno:debian-1.31.1`, installs Pup, and copies this directory content
  to `/app/`
- [pup.jsonc](https://github.com/Hexagon/pup/tree/main/docs/examples/docker/pup.jsonc) - Pup configuration, sets up `task.ts` to run at cron schedule `0/5 * * * * *` (every fifth second).
- [task.ts](https://github.com/Hexagon/pup/tree/main/docs/examples/docker/task.ts) - The actual script to run. Prints "Task running" to console and exits.

## Building and running

`cd` to `/docs/examples/docker` directory.

**Build image**

Run `docker build . --tag=pup-docker-demo`

**Run image**

Run `docker run -d --name="pup-demo" pup-docker-demo`

**Check logs to verify everything is working**

Run `docker logs pup-demo`

```
