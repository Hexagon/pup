![PUP](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hexagon/pup@master/docs/resources/pup_dark.png)

Pup is a powerful universal process manager developed with Deno, designed to keep your applications and services alive.

_For detailed documentation, visit [hexagon.github.io/pup](https://hexagon.github.io/pup)._

## Key Features

- **Cross-platform and wide OS compatibility:** Manage processes for various languages and platforms, such as Deno, Node.js, Python, and Ruby on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Process management:** Define, control, and manage your processes with simple commands and configuration options.
- **Multiple start/restart policies:** Set up processes to start automatically, on a schedule (using cron expressions), or when files change.
- **Service management**: Built-in installer for Linux (sysvinit, systemd, upstart), macOS, and Windows services.
- **Clustering and load balancing:** Scale your application seamlessly with built-in clustering and load balancing capabilities.
- **Plugins:** Extend Pup's functionality with custom plugins for additional features and integrations.
- **Process Telemetry and IPC:** Pup can gather telemetry data from Deno client processes, such as memory usage and current working directory, providing deeper insights into managed processes. The
  telemetry feature also enables inter-process communication, allowing connected processes to interact with one another.

> **Note**: Programmatic usage, process telemetry, and IPC are currently available only when running Deno client processes.

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Install [Deno](https://deno.com/manual/getting_started/installation) on your system.
2. Install or upgrade Pup using Deno:

```bash
# Install
deno install -Afr https://deno.land/x/pup/pup.ts

# Upgrade/Downgrade
pup upgrade
```

This command downloads the Pup executable and installs it on your system. The `A` flag grants all permissions, `f` overwrites any existing installation, and `r` ensures no cache is used.

### Usage Examples

**Single command example**

Use `pup run` with `--cmd` and a restart policy, for example `--autostart`, this will keep your process running, and require no configuration.

`pup run --cmd "deno run server.ts" --autostart`

**Ecosystem example**

1. Initialise a new configuration file `pup.json`, running a server script using deno.

   `pup init --id "my-server" --cmd "deno run -A server.ts" --autostart`

2. Add hourly task using the cron start policy.

   `pup append --id "my-task" --cmd "deno run -A task.ts" --cron "0 0 * * * *"`

3. Launch your ecosystem.

   `pup run`

4. Optional: Install your ecosystem as a system service. Works systemd, sysvinit, upstart, launchd and Windows service manager.

   `pup service install --name my-service`
